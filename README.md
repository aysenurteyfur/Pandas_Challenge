# Pandas Challenge
In this assignment, i created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
## Background 

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


# PyCitySchool Analysis

According to results;

- We can say that students in all grades had almost similar academic performance across all categories. 
- Average math and reading scores stay consistent across grade level when grouped by school.
- The top 5 schools are all charter schools while the bottom 5 all district schools.
- Small-sized (less than 1000 students) and medium-sized (1000 to 2000 students) schools outperformed the large-sized schools (2000 to 5000 students) in terms of passing scores.
- The schools with the low spending ranges (less than $585 per student) had better average math and reading scores as well as better passing rates for students overall and in both math and reading.
